Welcome to the Sheets-to-Calendar script. To use this script there are a few things that we need to setup in order for Google to give us permission to use their service.

Please login to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and download the credentials file.

Once downloaded you will need to move the file into the working directory and rename to 'credentials.json'

Ensure that the script does not have any errors.

Use 'Python3 new_sheets_to_calendar.py' to retrieve the values from google sheets.
